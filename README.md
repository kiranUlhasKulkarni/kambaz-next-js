## Overview

Kambaz is a feature-rich LMS that replicates core Canvas functionality. It supports two user roles — **Student** and **Faculty** — each with distinct capabilities across courses, modules, assignments, and quizzes. The frontend is a Next.js 14 App Router application using Redux Toolkit for global state management and React Bootstrap for UI components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm or yarn
- Backend server running (see [backend repo](https://github.com/kiran-ulhas-kulkarni/kambaz-node-server-app))

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiran-ulhas-kulkarni/kambaz-next-js.git
cd kambaz-next-js
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

Make sure your backend is running at `http://localhost:4000` or update `NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER` accordingly.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER=http://localhost:4000
```

For production (Vercel), set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER=https://<your-render-url>.onrender.com
```

---

## Deployment

This app is deployed on **Vercel**.

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Import the repo into [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER` environment variable to your live Render backend URL
4. Deploy

> **Note:** After updating environment variables in Vercel, always redeploy for changes to take effect.
